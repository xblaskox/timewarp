For anyone who was into the scene in the 90s, visualizers were all the rage, half a decade before Microsoft started putting visualizers on their audio players. 
There were many visualizers out there but the big one that always stuck with me was called "AcidWarp". 
Originally created by Noah Spurrier and Mark Bilk back in 1992, it was designed to run on MS-DOS. 

I remember some kid named Colin throwing me a disk with this on it. We always traded disks, near daily, with hacked nes roms, nes roms, pranks, progz, sploits, warez stuff. 
This wasn't a "screen saver" but oh man did I leave it on. 

I've managed to recreate three of the animated color pallet cycling visualizations as a test in python. 
Just something for the old times. Soon, I will do a complete remake with extra features as a project called "TimeWarp", as a tribute to one of the best and one of the originals.
